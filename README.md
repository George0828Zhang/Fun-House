### WeaponAddons

- Self->Weapons tab.
- Fire Ammo: enable the fireammo cheat from SP.
- Gangsta Aim: enable gangsta aim with vanilla pistol (only).
- Anti-Vehicle Gun: shoot once to kill engine of any vehicle. (= context menu->killengine, but automatic)

### Wolverine
- Self tab.
- Regenerates x health/armour every k frames (x, k configurable).
- You appear as if spamming snacks rather than Godmode.

### UnlockWebsiteCars
- Vehicle tab.
- Unlocks website purchase of removed/unreleased cars.

### Reports
- Network->Reports tab.
- Show/clear player reports.


### (WIP) Thermal
- Self->Weapons tab
- Turn on/off thermal with E when aiming any gun (just like mk2 sniper). 
- Currently only works when you equip quad lens and turn it on first. If you know how to bypass MP thermal block pls lemme know.
