# GTAVYimmenuScripts

Some Yimmenu scripts I made, or copied from others' (listed in credits).

Descriptions:
- CustomStickyBombs: Self->Weapons tab, replace your sticky bombs with demolition charge in heists, very fun. Recommend with Self->Weapons->Increase Sticky Limit to 50.
- WeaponAddons: Self->Weapons tab
    - Fire Ammo: enables the fireammo cheat from SP.
    - Gangsta Aim: enable gangsta aim with vanilla pistol (only).
    - Anti-Vehicle Gun: shoot once to kill engine of any vehicle. (= yimmenu's context menu option but automatic)
- Wolverine: Self tab, regenerate health/armour every k frames. you appear as if spamming snacks rather than Godmode.
- UnlockWebsiteCars: Vehicle tab, unlock website purchase of removed/unreleased cars  
- Reports: Network->Reports tab, show/clear player reports.

## Incomplete
- Thermal: Self->Weapons tab, turn on/off thermal with E when aiming any gun (just like mk2 sniper). Currently only works when you equip quad lens and turn it on first. If you know how to bypass MP thermal block pls lemme know.
